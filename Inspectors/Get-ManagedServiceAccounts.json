	"Description": "A standalone Managed Service Account (sMSA) is a managed domain account that provides automatic password management, simplified service principal name (SPN) management and the ability to delegate the management to other administrators. This type of managed service account (MSA) was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7.\nThe group Managed Service Account (gMSA) provides the same functionality within the domain but also extends that functionality over multiple servers.",
	"Remediation": "Evaluate existing service accounts and determine if any are suitable candidates for replacement with a Managed Service Account. It is recommended to migrate to a Managed Service Account as systems are replaced or upgraded, until all user-based service accounts have been retired.",
