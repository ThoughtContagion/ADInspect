	"Description": "Accounts with passwords that are older than 120 days were identified. Passwords that remain unchanged for long periods of time are more susceptable to being cracked",
	"Remediation": "Identified accounts should have their passwords changed. This can be accomplished by setting the 'Must change password at next logon' flag, or running the following PowerShell command: 'Get-ADUser -filter {(PasswordLastSet -lt (Get-Date).adddays(-120)) -and (PasswordNeverExpires -eq $false)} | Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true'. Additionally, Group Policy Objects and Domain Password Policies should be enforced on all accounts.",
