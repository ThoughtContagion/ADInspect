	"Description": "Active Directory accounts with the adminCount flag with a value greater than 0 can be abused by an attacker to elevate privileges. If an account has ever had administrative rights, this flag remains set even after those permissions are removed.",
	"Remediation": "Validate the list of users that are expected to have admin rights. For any other accounts, including disabled accounts, running the following PowerShell command in a foreach loop against a list of accounts will resolve the finding: set-aduser -replace @{admincount=0}. For example, the following command will reset the adminCount attribute on all disabled accounts: Get-ADUser -filter {(admincount -like '1') -and (enabled -eq $false)} | set-aduser -replace @{admincount=0}",
