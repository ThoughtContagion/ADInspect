	"FindingName": "Computers with Unconstrained Delegation Found",
	"Description": "Unconstrained Delegation allows systems to impersonate any service(s) using any user or system account to perform a given task. Attackers can compromise any system with this permission set and abuse the delegation to impersonate privileged users and systems, leading to a domain takeover.",
	"Remediation": "This can be remediated by setting delegation on the machine account for specified services only. This can be taken a step further by enforcing Resource-based constrained delegation. Discussions should be had with any stakeholders to ensure that legacy systems and services required for business operation are not adversely affected.",
	"AffectedObjects": "",
