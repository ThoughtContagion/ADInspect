	"Description": "Users and admins sometimes store sensitive information in the Description field of an Active Directory account.

Attackers take advantage of this and abuse the information stored in this attribute.",

If the information types found are required for necessary business practices, first consult with stakeholders and members of leadership or legal teams, and consider using Confidential Attributes.",
